Custom Chatbot using GPT-2

ðŸ“Œ Project Description â€“ 

This project is about building and fine-tuning a chatbot model using the GPT-2 language model. We trained it on a dataset of conversational text and then used it to generate human-like replies.

ðŸ”¹ Methods and Techniques Used
1. Data Preparation

We started with a text dataset containing dialogues/conversations.

We tokenized the text using Hugging Faceâ€™s GPT-2 tokenizer, which converts words into token IDs (numbers) that the model can understand.

We padded sequences with special tokens so that all inputs had the same length.

Finally, we created PyTorch Datasets and DataLoaders to organize the data into batches (mini-groups of training samples).

2. Model Setup

We used GPT2LMHeadModel (GPT-2 with a language modeling head).

Model architecture:

Embedding layers for word tokens and positional encodings

Transformer blocks (multi-head attention + feed-forward layers)

Layer normalization and dropout for regularization

A final linear layer (lm_head) to predict the next token

The model was loaded with pretrained GPT-2 weights from Hugging Face.

3. Training Process

We trained the model using PyTorch.

Loss Function: CrossEntropyLoss (measures how well the model predicts the next token).

Optimizer: AdamW (a variant of Adam optimizer, good for transformers).

Learning Rate: A small value (like 5e-5) to ensure stable fine-tuning.

Epochs: The dataset was repeated multiple times (epochs) to improve learning.

During training, we observed the Average Loss decreasing (e.g., from ~2.06 to ~1.76). Lower loss = better learning.

4. Saving the Model

After training, we saved the model files:

config.json â€“ model configuration

generation_config.json â€“ text generation settings

model.safetensors â€“ trained model weights

These files can be reloaded anytime to continue training or use the chatbot.

5. Text Generation / Chatbot

For interaction, we used the generate() method from Hugging Face.

We applied decoding strategies:

Top-k sampling: pick the most likely k words (e.g., k=50).

Top-p sampling (nucleus sampling): pick words until their probability mass â‰¥ p (e.g., p=0.95).

Temperature scaling: controls creativity/randomness (lower = safe, higher = more creative).

We built a simple chatbot loop where the user types a message and the model generates a reply.

ðŸ”¹ Key Techniques Used

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Transformers & GPT-2

Fine-tuning pretrained models

PyTorch for training and batching

Sampling techniques (top-k, top-p, temperature)

Model saving and reloading

ðŸ”¹ Limitations

The dataset was relatively small â†’ chatbot sometimes gave unrelated answers.

GPT-2 is not specialized for dialogues (unlike GPT-3/ChatGPT).

More training data and epochs would improve results.
